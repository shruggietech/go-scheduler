## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Spec-driven development scaffolding via Spec Kit:
  - Project constitution (v1.0.0) — code quality, testing standards, UX consistency, performance.
  - Feature specification for the cross-platform task scheduler (`specs/001-task-scheduler/`),
    including clarifications and a one-off (non-recurring) scheduling mode.
  - Implementation plan, research, data model, CLI & local-API contracts, and quickstart.
  - Dependency-ordered task breakdown (78 tasks across 8 phases).
- Repository basics: Apache 2.0 license, README, changelog, and TODO.
- **Foundational implementation (Phases 1–2, tasks T001–T019):**
  - Go module, `golangci-lint` config, `Makefile`, and `.gitattributes`.
  - `internal/platform` — build-tagged data dirs and windowless process-spawn helper.
  - `internal/clock` — injectable `Clock` with real and deterministic fake implementations.
  - `internal/config` — single config schema, fail-fast validation, structured `slog` logging.
  - `internal/domain` + `internal/store` — core entities and durable SQLite persistence
    (pure-Go, cgo-free) with migrations and CRUD.
  - `internal/ipc` — local transport (Unix socket / Windows named pipe).
  - `internal/api` — local HTTP/JSON API server (health, error envelope) and shared client.
  - `cmd/goschedd` (daemon) and `cmd/gosched` (CLI): the daemon serves health over IPC and the
    CLI reaches it — end-to-end architecture verified.
